the World Championships or Olympic Games, having finished sixth at Rio 2016 and sixth in Budapest in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>She said: \u201cI\u2019m obviously a little bit disappointed, as after last

50.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t complain though as I\u2019ve had a much busier week than I expected and the 100 went so much better than I expected, so maybe that\u2019s taken it out of me a little

complain.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would have liked to have gone quicker but I\u2019m way more motivated now and just want to get back in the training pool and piece everything together for next
