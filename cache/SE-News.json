the World Championships or Olympic Games, having finished sixth at Rio 2016 and sixth in Budapest in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>She said: \u201cI\u2019m obviously a little bit disappointed, as after last

50.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t complain though as I\u2019ve had a much busier week than I expected and the 100 went so much better than I expected, so maybe that\u2019s taken it out of me a little

complain.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would have liked to have gone quicker but I\u2019m way more motivated now and just want to get back in the training pool and piece everything together for next

qualify in third place overall, behind American Caeleb Dressel and Brazilian Bruno Fratus.<\/p>\n<p>The Plymouth Leander swimmer won bronze in this event in 2017, when he also won gold in the 50m Butterfly.<\/p>\n<p>Having just missed out on a medal at the 2016 Olympic Games, Proud will be determined to make a statement in Saturday\u2019s final ahead of Tokyo 2020.<\/p>\n<p>He said: \u201cIt was very close to my season\u2019s best, only a couple of fractions out, so if I can step it on again tomorrow night, which is probably what it\u2019s going to take to get onto the podium, then I\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Guy returns to final<\/h2>\n<p>James Guy is through to the final of the Men\u2019s 100m Butterfly after holding his own in a blistering heat.<\/p>\n<p>Guy finished fourth in a season\u2019s best time of 51.69s to qualify seventh fastest, as American Caeleb Dressel smashed Michael Phelps\u2019 world record in 49.50s.<\/p>\n<p>The National Centre Bath swimmer will be encouraged by the qualifying times of those above him.<\/p>\n<p>Only Dressel went quicker than Guy\u2019s personal best time of 50.67s.<\/p>\n<p>Guy won bronze in the 100m Butterfly final at the 2017 World Championships in Budapest, before also winning bronze at the 2018 European Championships and silver at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.<\/p>\n<h2>Fullalove bows out<\/h2>\n<p>Jessica Fullalove fell short in her bid to make a first ever world final as she finished eighth in her Women\u2019s 200m Backstroke semi-final.<\/p>\n<p>The British champion swam just shy of her heat time, touching the wall in 2:11.12.<\/p>\n<p>In an immensely competitive field, Fullalove would have needed to significantly improve her personal best to have had a chance of reaching the final.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Luke Greenbank swam a lifetime best to win a bronze medal in the Men\u2019s 200m Backstroke at the FINA World Championships.
