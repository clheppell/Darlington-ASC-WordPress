With 25m to go I was jumping up and down like never before and the last 10 metres he just got his head down and took him out.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor me, that\u2019s better than Olympic gold and anything else, as when you do it as a team, and the fact the Americans have never been beaten in this event I don\u2019t think, it\u2019s just amazing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe took it out fairly aggressive. At the Olympics I think it will be a different race.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Greenbank said: \u201cI just wanted to try and put the boys in the best possible position and I knew if I could get there within Peaty range he\u2019d be able to pull it back and he did an amazing job.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And Guy added: \u201cI knew Adam would do a massive job for us and Luke did an amazing job as well, so there was pressure as we were all in a line together and it was a very close race.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI know my back end, when I\u2019m on form, is really good and if I could get there close to Dressel we\u2019d have a good chance of medalling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It was the first time Britain have topped the podium in the men\u2019s 4x100m Medley Relay.<\/p>\n<h2>Women&#8217;s team finish eighth<\/h2>\n<p>The Women\u2019s 4x100m Medley Relay team of Georgia Davies, Molly Renshaw, Alys Thomas and Freya Anderson finished eighth in a race dominated by the United States.<\/p>\n<p>They shattered the world record to take the gold medal in a time of 3:50.40 \u2013 more than three seconds ahead of the second-placed Australians.<\/p>\n<p>Britain clocked 3:59.38 \u2013 which was slightly quicker than their heat time of 3:59.74.<\/p>\n<h2>Hopkin impresses again in final<\/h2>\n<p>Anna Hopkin finished seventh in her first World Championship final in the Women\u2019s 50m Freestyle.<\/p>\n<p>The Ealing and University of Arkansas swimmer had set two new personal bests to reach the final \u2013 bettering her heat time in the semi-final as she qualified seventh fastest.<\/p>\n<p>And in a final full of quality, Hopkin again showed her potential as she finished in 24.40 \u2013 the second quickest time of her career.<\/p>\n<p>Less than half a second separated the whole field as America\u2019s Simone Manuel took the gold in 24.05.<\/p>\n<p>Sweden\u2019s Sarah Sjoestroem was second in 24.07, while the bronze was won by Australia\u2019s Cate Campbell in 24.11.<\/p>\n<p>Hopkin said: \u201cIt was only very slightly slower than in the semi-final so I\u2019m very happy to have been able to produce a consistent swim.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYesterday my start went so well, but I didn\u2019t quite get the finish, whereas today I was just slightly off on the start, but these are tiny details I can work on next year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy goals were to make semi-finals \u2013 in the 100m and the 50m I was ranked 19<sup>th<\/sup> and 20<sup>th<\/sup>coming in, so the goal was to try and sneak into semi-finals, so to come seventh in the world in the 50 and just miss out on the final in the 100 is definitely more than I expected \u2013 I\u2019m really happy.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Strong fight from Max<\/h2>\n<p>Max Litchfield put up a strong fight for a medal in the Men\u2019s 400m Individual Medley but eventually finished seventh.<\/p>\n<p>He was lying fourth at the halfway stage of the race but couldn\u2019t keep up with the pace shown by Japan\u2019s Daiya Seto, who touched him first in 4:08.95.<\/p>\n<p>Litchfield, who qualified fourth fastest, couldn\u2019t match his heat time of 4:14.35 as he clocked 4:14.75.<\/p>\n<p>He said: \u201cYeah, I attacked it as that was the only way I was going to do anything, but I don\u2019t really know what to say, it\u2019s just disappointing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked hard this year and I\u2019ve had a great training year and that\u2019s not good enough for me, nowhere near.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to look back at the race and see what we need to change and what we need to work on, but I\u2019ve had a great year and it\u2019s tough to not see the results I should be getting.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut you make mistakes and you learn, so we\u2019ll come back better.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Great Britain finished seventh in the swimming medal table having won seven medals in the pool \u2013 three golds, one silver and three bronze.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Great Britain grabbed a sensational gold medal in the final session of the FINA World Championships after an astonishing relay display.
